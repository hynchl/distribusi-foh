At the moment I enjoy living and working in the spectrum between activist and filmmaker. One of my favorite things to do is to plan and realize ideas with those whom I’ve encountered in Gangjeong. I’m also part of a performance art-activist collective called ‘Crow Flock’.Generally, I’m interested in making relationships with others through the medium of camera, documenting collective memories and making film as a field of senses and solidarity. These days I’m concerned with how I can live as a queer feminist in Gangjeong village. I hope this perspective could be reflected in my everyday life and my work. "
