        We are collecting some fragments. The mutually dependent differences exist like the snow crystals that drift without any past, future, or memory, while refusing to become identical, and revealing each one of them as they glitter. We try to imagine the art of the future based on these fragments.

        <b>Story Behind the Design of Fragments of Hospitality</b></br>
        In an academic paper on “snow crystals”, Dr. Ukichiro Nakaya presents years of his observation pertaining to how and in what forms the snow crystals are formed. Contrary to the common understanding that they only take a couple of forms, snow crystals actually assume numerous forms depending on climate, temperature, and region. The fact that white snow crystals that come to us on a dark winter night as if they are giving us hospitality, in fact, reveal such diverse types and shapes, seems to fit right into our “fragments of hospitality” project. Like Dr. Nakaya,  inspired by the work done by various artists and participants, we draw forms that have become abstract. Eventually, those fragments would diversify to have emotions, glitter like the snow crystals, or become mixed together and turn into water.
       </br></br>
       <b>Methods of connection</b></br>
       Individuals collecting fragments each have their own folder. When they put a story, picture, audio, or video file inside a folder, each fragment is assigned a serial number, and gets accumulated in the fragments of hospitality website.The fragments connect us. 
	We hope that we can choose the “nature and attitude” of the medium that mediates our connection.
	</br></br>
       *We borrowed the method of exchange and sharing from distribusi, a project that proposes the form of publication that documents and updates communal project.
